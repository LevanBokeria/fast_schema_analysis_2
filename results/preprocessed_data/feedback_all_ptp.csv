ptp,Clear instructions?,Notice schema_C,Notice schema_IC,Notice landmarks,Notice random,Strategy?,Did visible ones help or hinder?,Anything else
sub_001,add instruction to try learn and memorise the positions of the hidden images.,yes,yes,no,yes,learn position in terms of edge of the board,visible pictures helped when they stayed in the same position.,show hidden image position before trial so can try learn them easier
sub_002,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Visualising them clockwise around the board in order,"Helped on the board where they stayed the same, otherwise hindered so I just ignored them",NA
sub_003,"Yes, they were.",Yes,"No, I didn't notice.","No, I didn't notice.",Yes,"Yes my strategy was to map out in my mind where each of the pictures were, kind of like connecting the dots. I didn't do this for all of the boards.",I think it sort of helped. I couldn't see the visible pictures when I had to make the selection so that further made it more difficult.,n/a
sub_004,Yes they were clear,Yes,No I didn't notice,No I didn't notice,Yes,I tried to imagine a grid in my head for some of them. Others I tried to remember what visible pitcures they were next to.,It depended on the board. When the visible pictures stayed the same it somewhat helped.,n/a
sub_005,Yes,Not sure,Not sure,Not sure,Not sure,No,Hinder,No
sub_006,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,helped when didn't move,fun :)
sub_007,"Yes, the instructions were clear.","No, I didn't notice this.",I noticed that the pictures moved each time.,I noticed that some picture moved but couldn't say which ones.,I noticed that the picture changed around.,I tried to learn where each picture was within the coloured box and ignored the visible pictures as I found them distracting.,I found that the visible pictures hindered me so tried to ignore them.,A progress bar would have been helpful. Or something to say how many rounds I had left to do.
sub_008,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,"On earlier boards, I tried to learn the locations relative to the visual pictures. In the middle few boards I learned some relative to the pictures and others relative to the background square. In the last board I tried to visualise an axis on the board. ","Helped to a point. Only the first two boards were completely healpful. The third board was useful for learning some of the locations. After this, the pictures were not useful, but not a distraction either. The final board was more difficult.",N/A
sub_009,yes very clear,not sure i noticed,did notice pictures moved,not sure i did,didnt notice that,try and remember invisble ones only,hinder i found more distracting,nothing else
sub_010,"yes, it was a very challenging task but were clear. ",yes,yes,no,no,yes,sometimes helped but also at time's hindered depending on the objects in the pictures and the board.,no thank you.
