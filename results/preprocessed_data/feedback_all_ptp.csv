ptp,Clear instructions?,Notice schema_C,Notice schema_IC,Notice landmarks,Notice random,Strategy?,Did visible ones help or hinder?,Anything else
sub_001,add instruction to try learn and memorise the positions of the hidden images.,yes,yes,no,yes,learn position in terms of edge of the board,visible pictures helped when they stayed in the same position.,show hidden image position before trial so can try learn them easier
sub_002,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Visualising them clockwise around the board in order,"Helped on the board where they stayed the same, otherwise hindered so I just ignored them",NA
sub_003,"Yes, they were.",Yes,"No, I didn't notice.","No, I didn't notice.",Yes,"Yes my strategy was to map out in my mind where each of the pictures were, kind of like connecting the dots. I didn't do this for all of the boards.",I think it sort of helped. I couldn't see the visible pictures when I had to make the selection so that further made it more difficult.,n/a
sub_004,Yes they were clear,Yes,No I didn't notice,No I didn't notice,Yes,I tried to imagine a grid in my head for some of them. Others I tried to remember what visible pitcures they were next to.,It depended on the board. When the visible pictures stayed the same it somewhat helped.,n/a
sub_005,Yes,Not sure,Not sure,Not sure,Not sure,No,Hinder,No
sub_006,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,helped when didn't move,fun :)
sub_007,"Yes, the instructions were clear.","No, I didn't notice this.",I noticed that the pictures moved each time.,I noticed that some picture moved but couldn't say which ones.,I noticed that the picture changed around.,I tried to learn where each picture was within the coloured box and ignored the visible pictures as I found them distracting.,I found that the visible pictures hindered me so tried to ignore them.,A progress bar would have been helpful. Or something to say how many rounds I had left to do.
sub_008,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,Yes.,"On earlier boards, I tried to learn the locations relative to the visual pictures. In the middle few boards I learned some relative to the pictures and others relative to the background square. In the last board I tried to visualise an axis on the board. ","Helped to a point. Only the first two boards were completely healpful. The third board was useful for learning some of the locations. After this, the pictures were not useful, but not a distraction either. The final board was more difficult.",N/A
sub_009,yes very clear,not sure i noticed,did notice pictures moved,not sure i did,didnt notice that,try and remember invisble ones only,hinder i found more distracting,nothing else
sub_010,"yes, it was a very challenging task but were clear. ",yes,yes,no,no,yes,sometimes helped but also at time's hindered depending on the objects in the pictures and the board.,no thank you.
sub_011,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No strategy,Yes a bit.,n/a
sub_012,"Very clear, easy to understand.","I believe the blue board was one of my more successful boards, and found it fairly simple on second attempt.",I did not notice.,"The red board was one of the more difficult for me to remember, and I wasn't feeling like I were closer to understanding it even after my second attempt.","Yes, I did notice and I struggled the most with this board.","The last board was the easiest due to no visible pictures throwing me off and the patterns were not changed. With the other boards my strategy was to just try and remember what visible pictures were close by the hidden pictures and play off that. Which is why I struggled with the yellow board the most, as that strategy would not work.","They hindered me on the yellow board. The last board was the easiest, so I would say they hindered me overall more than actually helping me.","I enjoyed my experience, I can't think of anything right now that could have improved my participation. Thank you."
sub_013,All instructions were clear,Yes,Yes,No,No,I tended to ignore the visible pictures all together and try to split the box up into  grid of smaller squares in my mind and try to remember where on the grid the hidden pictures were,I did not really take notice of the visible pictures at all on the boards where images moved. I noticed the visible pictures on the static board and this did help slightly when picturing some of the hidden images,No
sub_014,they were clear,yes ,no - i just thought they moved around randomly,no,yes,"my strategy was to remember the locations relative to the centre, it stayed the same for all boards","visible [pictures hindered me. i thought it was much easier without them, they were a distraction",no
sub_015,they were clear.,"yes, which made it much easier.","i believe so, I know a lot of them moved.",Yes.,Yes which made it the hardest board.,"yes, try and find out which moved first, then link it to the position of a specific hidden image if possible.","visible's helped if they stayed put, hindered if they moved.",no
sub_016,yes,no,yes,yes,no,created a network diagram in my head for all boards,"hinder, added confusion.",no
sub_017,Yes,I don't remember,I don't remember,I don't remember,I don't remember,Only until later on did I find a slight pattern but it was difficult to follow without a grid,They helped sometimes,Nope
sub_018,yes,yes,no,no,no,"no, maybe should have tho!",helped,no
sub_019,The instructions were clear.,No,No,No,No,"I had the same strategy for every board, which was to try and ignore the visible pictures and remember the hidden pictures independently of them.",I think I did the best on the boards with no visible pictures so I guess that means the visible pictures hindered me.,No
sub_020,Yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,"trying to ignore the moving visible pictures and focus on locations of hidden objects, same for each board","initially hinder, then help.",nope. it was fun. good luck with the research.
sub_021,yes,think so,think so,think so,"board looked orange to me,think so","yes, what they were beside/below then made up a small story about their placing,then had to switch to where they were because of images moving location",they were distracting,please pay the minimum hourly wage that is Â£6 per hour for Prolific
sub_022,Instructions were clear for all stages.,Yes I noticed this on the blue board.,Yes I noticed they had changed on the green board.,Yes I did notice this change but I was concentrating more on where the new images were appearing so I could remember this.,Yes I did notice this.,I used the strategy of just squaring with my fingers in the screen of the exact location for each new item so I could remember it.,"I think the visible pictures helped when they stayed in one spot, but it did not help that the images were changing around in the other trials and this made it more difficult to find and remember the item.",The one thing is the screen size.  This trial should be made to fit the screen and not have me make adjustments to my screen.  The screen becoming smaller to fit the trial made it harder to see the objects on the screen because they became a lot smaller.
sub_023,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Just tried to remember them according to north south east west,visible pictures were distracting,N/a
sub_024,yes they were clear,Yes,Yes,I noticed movement of pictures but couldn't have identified that pattern.,Yes,I sometimes tried to split the square up as though it were a clock face.  I don't feel it gave me great success though.,"I felt it depended on the board, but sometimes, yes.",none
sub_025,Yes,Yes,I noticed that on a board or two the locations changed but can't remember which colour was that board.,Not particularly so that I can name what was moved and what was fixed,No,"I was trying to learn the location with respect to the size of the board. I was trying to divide the board in half and draw some imaginary lines and compare with respect to those that was my main strategy. Initially I was trying to use other pictures, in the first few boards I was trying to use the location of the visible pictures as cue, but that seemed harder with the visible pictures changing and their location changing as well. So I changed strategy and decided to learn the locations with respect to the middle of the board (horizontally and vertically) and this was easier.","Hinder me, didn't like them very much, the board that didn't have the visible pictures (I think it was the purple board) was the easiest/best. Shame my PC froze for a second and I missed some of the trials on that board.","The location was extremely sensitive, I hope you calculate the distance from where I clicked to where the object was rather than the correct and incorrect feedbacks. Probably more than 90% of the time I was clicking very very close, some of which I might have missed by a single pixel, seriously, it was too sensitive to the exact location of the items."
